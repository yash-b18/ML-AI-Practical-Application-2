<h2>Findings</h2>
Based on the 3 models built, we found that linear regression model performed the best and fastest. The model's predictive analysis had a major impact from odometer, year, and with slight impact from type of vehicle. As manufacturer outliers were removed from the data such as ferrari, where value of car is extremely high and not as common, it is conclusive that common household vehicle manufacturers all operate on equal grounds.
<br>
<br>
It is also safe to say that odometer and year of the vehicle have positive impact and negative impact of the price. When observing the relationship of price and year, if we take year as the age, then price decays over time.

<h2>Recommendations</h2>
Used car dealerships will be more profitable with cars that are relatively newer and relatively have lower numbers on the odometer.

<h2><b>Next steps</b></h2>
Exploring how region impacts prices as well as specific features of vehicles such as number of cylinders, transmission, and title status should be used to build further models. The current exploration utilizes basic features on a general scale, ignoring specific vehicle configurations.
